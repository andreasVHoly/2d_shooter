Readme for Assignment 1 CSC3020H, Computer Games Course

The aim of the assignment was to create a 2 player 2D top down shooter in Unity 3D.



Game Idea:

This is a post-apocalyptic zombie shooter where 2 players fight against zombies. They each have a flash light that runs on batteries which drain with time. The flash lights allow them to only see certain parts of the game world.




Aim of the Game:

The aim of the game is to get to the blue beacons which allow the players to progress to the next level. They need to do this in the shortest time possible as their ability to see drains away with the flashlight battery draining. See how to play menu for more info on game objects.

Open the game exe and maneuver through the screens for desired effect. Or load the assets and project settings folder into Unity.
